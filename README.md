### Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis     [[Read More](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1te5SLO4kWI6TOOHaV2jgt3w7M-n2tNiN?authuser=2)]

Covid-19 sentiment analysis is the practice to identify and extract subjective information from text data related to the Covid-19 pandemic. This can include sentiments, emotions, opinions, and other potentially useful information that can be used to understand the public's reaction to the pandemic and useful for decision making. The insights gained from this analysis can be useful for fighting against the pandemic and strategy or policy making.

We have used aspect-based sentiment analysis to classify public opinion about covid19 twitter data and the sentiment of the people worldwide. To extract the aspects of twitter data we used fast-text model and to classify the sentiments of the data we used in various machine learning and deep learning models. Based on the obtained results, we chose the deep learning model as the best performing model for the classification task.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
